I have been enjoying the goods and bad of the Finance Industry for the last eleven years. Starting out in the Automotive Industry selling vehicles and moving my way up into the Financial Department as an assistant.
Currently I have worked my way up the latter to run my own Credit and Collections Department for a multimillion dollar company, evaluating lines of credit and making sure we get paid on the terms by our clients.


This year , after being sent home to work remotely with an undefined return date make me realized that I will be spending the most of my time at home at lease for the rest of the year. I started to evaluate and consider new beginnings with the tools I have in this current pandemic state that we all are in. Time could have not been more perfect now to get back to school and pursue a new career challenge, one that also will provide a higher level of financial security to my family.

Six months ago I crashed into an ad from //Flatiron School by accident on social media. I stared a research on the courses advertised on their webpage, founding positive feedbacks from current and former students but, not only that. Important Universities like Georgia Tech also started to offer curriculums as “bootcamps”. I tough to myself that this has to be good option if an important tech university is supporting this type of programs. Then, my research took me to sites like Glassdoor and Indeed for a career evaluation. To my surprise the findings on Software Engineering as a career was promising.

The decition to incorporate a new challenge into my life was taken two months ago when I joined the Career Karma community, also exploring apps like “Mimo” and “SoloLearn” where I was able to deep into coding and actually talk to great people with the same goals as me. Then, the next step was to find out if coding was a practice I was going to enjoy doing, so I started the Software Engineering Prep Course.
Discovering HTML, CSS, JavaScript pushed me to send in my application for a new journey. It is just amazing that putting together a few variables, methods, etc.. we can obtain a desire output, like in finance playing with different factors and statistics will give you a final result.

Software development is growing, evolving and leading the world as we humans become more dependent of technology each and every day. I want to be part of that movement.
